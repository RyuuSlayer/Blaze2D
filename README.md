# Blaze2D
A Lightweight Java game engine focusing on blazing fast 2D rendering, while having 3D support.

To compile the engine use LWJGL3 and put it into a lib folder next so src and res, https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3-wiki/wiki/1.2.-Install this is a simple guide to make the libs work in your IDE, i recommend to use IntelliJ.

You will need OpenGL, OpenAL, GLFW and Vulkan Libs.
I recommend using atleast Java JDK 15.
